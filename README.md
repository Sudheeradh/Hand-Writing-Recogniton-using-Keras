# Hand Writing Recogniton using Keras
Created my first neural network that classifies hand written digits with over 98% accuracy from scratch using Keras and TensorFlow. 
Training and test data is obtained from MNIST.
The neural network consists of 3 fully connected layers with dropout applied at every layer for regularizatoin.
